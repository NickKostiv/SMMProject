    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

    <h2>1. Services Provided</h2>
    <p>
      Hub offers you, among other things, the ability to record local toll,
      domestic long distance and international telephone calls. These services
      are provided on a free or pre-paid basis and do not require you to change
      your current telephone service provider(s). Hub is not responsible for
      reimbursement for calls made with another service while Hub is temporarily
      unavailable.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Opening an Account</h2>
    <p>
      In order to become a Hub customer, you must complete an application form
      through our mobile app, and must agree to these terms and conditions. As
      part of the application, you will provide Hub with the unique phone number
      from which you will be placing calls. Hub will then send you an sms
      notification (in the form of a text message) to the unique number
      confirming that you have become a Hub customer and identifying your Hub
      account ("Account").
    </p>
    <p>
      By agreeing to these terms and conditions, you certify to Hub that you
      have the right to use the number that you have identified.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Acceptable Conduct</h2>
    <p>
      You agree to use the Hub services only for purposes that are lawful in the
      jurisdictions where you are calling from and calling to. You shall not
      transmit any unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing,
      defamatory, vulgar, obscene, sexually explicit, profane, hateful,
      racially, ethnically, or otherwise objectionable material of any kind,
      including but not limited to any material that encourages conduct that
      would constitute a criminal offense, gives rise to civil liability, or
      otherwise violates any applicable local, state, national, or international
      law.
    </p>
    <p>
      In particular, depending on the state or country in which you are located
      or the person you are calling is located, you may violate a country’s or a
      state’s criminal law or create civil liability for yourself by listening
      in on or recording a telephone conversation without informing the other
      parties that you are doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hub reserves the right to immediately, and without notice, terminate or
      discontinue your Account in the event it determines in its sole discretion
      that you have committed fraud or violated any applicable law or regulation
      or any term or condition of this Agreement. In order to combat harassing
      or illegal conduct, including fraud and unauthorized access to voicemail,
      Hub may monitor or record customers' calls and provide call detail records
      or recordings to law enforcement agencies.

      within one calendar day so that appropriate action can be taken to modify
      your Account. Please be aware that account information will be sent to the
      mobile phone number that you have provided to Hub. Hub is not responsible
      for the actions of any person that accesses the service through that phone
      number. Please note that you are responsible for any and all charges to
